### Description of the project
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?    
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer thinks of an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" I mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**
Learning to write good python code

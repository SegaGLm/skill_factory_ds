### Description of the project
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?    
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer thinks of an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" I mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
Learning to write good python code.

### Brief information about the data
We use the NumPy library to creates the number.

### Stages of work on the project
- Creating a program that creates and guesses a number randomly.
- Creating a repository on GitHub. Setting up branch synchronization and program commit.
- Modernization of the code to reduce the total number of attempts to guess the number.
- The final commit of the program.

### Results:
Uploaded working project on GitHub.

### Conclusions:
I thought that it would not be easy, but in the end it turned out that it was even more difficult.
